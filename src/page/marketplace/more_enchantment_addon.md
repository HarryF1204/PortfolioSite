# More Enchantments Addon
<Tag>Addon</Tag><Tag>2025</Tag>
## Description
Created by Eternal Creations, this innovative addon introduces 26 new enchantments to your Minecraft world. As the sole developer of this project, I ensured full compatibility with both vanilla enchantments and other addon enchantments, allowing players to combine and customize their gear like never before.

These powerful enchantments seamlessly integrate into the game, expanding your crafting possibilities while maintaining balance with existing gameplay mechanics.
