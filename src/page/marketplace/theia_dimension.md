# Theia Dimension
<Tag>Map</Tag><Tag>2024</Tag>

## Description
Theia Dimension is a Minecraft map made by eternal creations that introduces an entirely new dimension called "Theia" for players to explore. The map features five distinct biomes populated with custom mobs, unique items, tools, and challenging boss encounters. I was responsible for implementing core features including the hostile and passive mobs, dimension portal mechanics, custom blocks, and user interface elements.
