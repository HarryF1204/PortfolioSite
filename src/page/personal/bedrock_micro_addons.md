# Micro Addons
These are small addon ideas I decided to make as proof of concepts or as small additions to the game. For one reason or another, they were never made into full addons but they are still great showcase pieces.

## Portal-View Rendering
Uses advanced material techniques to render a 3D model through a "portal" while hiding entities and blocks within the area.

## Pocket Dimension Skybox Demo
A modified version of my skybox tech allowing for world geometry outside of a specified area to be entirely hidden, creating the illusion of a "pocket dimension" with it's own custom skybox.
